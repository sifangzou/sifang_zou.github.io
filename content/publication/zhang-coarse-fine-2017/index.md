abstract: Iris recognition inevitably need to tackle extremely large scale database
  matching issue which challenges the iris recognition in both computing efficiency
  and accuracy. As a feasible solution, the iris image classification has great potential
  and needs further studies. We propose a multi-variant Ordinal Measures feature complementarity
  based coarse-to-fine iris recognition strategy. Two OM variant feature are proposed
  for iris classification. One is very large scale OM feature (VLSOM), and the other
  is histogram statistics of OM Run-Length Coding (HOMRLC). VLSOM, HOMRLC and OM describes
  overall appearance, global statistic and local characteristics of iris respectively.
  Extensive experiments show advantages of the proposed complementarity feature.
