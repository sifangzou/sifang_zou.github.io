abstract: 'With the development of iris recognition, many identity authentication
  applications began to use this inherent biometric ID. Despite the breakthroughs
  in the identiﬁcation with iris recognition technology, one primary problem remains
  unsolved: the presentation spoof attack. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm
  4DCycle-GAN for expanding the spoof iris image database by synthesizing fake iris
  images wearing textured contact lenses. The proposed 4DCycle-GAN follows the CycleConsistent
  Adversarial Networks (Cycle-GAN) framework which translating between one kind images
  (genuine iris images) and one other kind images (textured contact lenses iris images).
  The 4DCycle-GAN introduces two more discriminators to improve the Cycle-GAN at the
  defect of lack of diversity. The two new discriminators ’prefer’ images generated
  by the generators, while the original discriminators in Cycle-GAN ’prefer’ real
  captured images. These new added confrontations make the 4DCycle-GAN avoid generating
  a certain kind of contact lenses texture which is larger percentage of the training
  iris database. The synthesized textured contact lenses iris images are used for
  spooﬁng iris detection training to improve the robustness of classiﬁcation algorithm.
  Both the Cycle-GAN and the 4DCycle-GAN synthesizing images can improve the spoof
  classiﬁcation results. Moreover, by using the 4DCycle-GAN, the spoof classiﬁcation
  results are distinctly improved for unrelated non-homologous database experiments.
  Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the anti-spoof
  ability of iris recognition system.'
